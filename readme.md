Write private notes within WordPress!

## Description

This plugins allows you to write private notes within WordPress.

* Adds a new custom post type for the notes.
* The notes cannot be published and will always remain private.
* You can create folders to organise the notes.

Together with the new PWA capabilities introduced by the [Gutenberg plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/), the notes could be accessed more easily through an app (mobile or desktop). 

### Security

Only you will be able to see your notes within the WordPress admin, but the notes are NOT encrypted at the moment, so anyone with database access will be able to read them.

### Support

Please report issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/ellatrix/hypernotes).

## Changelog

### 1.0.1

* Highlight the active folder in the admin menu.
* Allow notes to be trashed.

### 1.0.0

* Initial version.
